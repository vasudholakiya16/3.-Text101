  storyText: 'You tear off a piece of metal framing from your leather

    airship
    pilot armour and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts.

    As the door opens you
    rush at your captor, leaping like

    a crazy person and hollering a primal
    scream of rage.


    Payback time for your beating and from all the pain

    these
    dirty Festers have caused your family. You drive

    home your metal shiv. You
    hear the crunch of bones

    and feel the slice of flesh.'
