  storyText: 'Got to be something around here to help with some

    smashy smashy.
    You see a crate with all manner of pipes,

    wires and cogs scattered within
    it. Mostly trash.


    You could try the brute force approach - wack the lock
    with

    one of the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a

    contraption
    with some kind of leverage, maybe a mini

    pulley system with those wires
    and the cogs.

    How to proceed?

    1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start
    wacking.

    2. Take the time to build a leverage-gadget.'
