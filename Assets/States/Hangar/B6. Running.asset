  storyText: 'You run down a long comidor then up a flight of metal stairs. They
    make a

    loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery
    in this

    place is so loud


    In front of you is tee emergency exit door.
    It has an oversized, cast iron

    lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could
    try picking the lock, or maybe

    look for a way to pry it off.


    What
    to do?
