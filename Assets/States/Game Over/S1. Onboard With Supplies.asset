  storyText: 'You scramble aboard your airship. With all of your

    remaining strength,
    you lift the anchoring rope off its

    huge hook and give an all mighty shove.


    As
    you start to drift out of the hangar, you hear shouts

    of dismay from a nearby
    group of Festers.


    "So long suckers! May we never meet again!", you

    holler.
